# Use this file to prevent files from being overwritten by the generator.

#ignore tests, we don't need to write unit tests for generated code, it defeats the purpose of using a generator

#Don't write over the top of our readme with a generated one.  We can add any additional info here as needed.

#Don't override our custom .gitignore
